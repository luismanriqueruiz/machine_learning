# Integrating Polars and DuckDB

Both Polars and DuckDB are powerful tools for working with data, but they shine in different scenarios. Here's a breakdown to help you decide when to use each:

## Use polars when

| Scenario                                                                            | Why Polars Works Well                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ You need **fast, in-memory data processing**                                      | Polars is a blazing-fast DataFrame library (like pandas, but much faster and multicore by default). |
| ✅ You're doing **complex transformations** (joins, groupbys, aggregations, filters) | Polars has an expressive lazy API and handles large data well in memory.                            |
| ✅ You want to **process large CSV/Parquet files locally**                           | It's optimized for fast I/O and efficient memory usage.                                             |
| ✅ You prefer working **entirely in Python/Rust**                                    | Polars is written in Rust but has a very nice Python API.                                           |
| ✅ You want **eager or lazy execution modes**                                        | Lazy mode is great for chaining operations and optimizing them.                                     |
| ✅ You are building **data pipelines or ETL jobs**                                   | It’s perfect for pre-processing or transforming data before feeding into ML models.                 |

## Use DuckDB when

| Scenario                                                                             | Why DuckDB Works Well                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ You need **SQL support**                                                           | DuckDB is like SQLite for analytics, perfect for anyone comfortable with SQL. |
| ✅ You want to **query large Parquet/CSV files directly without loading into memory** | DuckDB can scan and query files efficiently on disk.                          |
| ✅ You need to **integrate with Pandas/Polars/Arrow**                                 | DuckDB plays well with these, so you can do SQL-on-Pandas/Polars.             |
| ✅ You're doing **ad-hoc analytics or prototyping dashboards**                        | It’s great for interactive exploration.                                       |
| ✅ You want to **join multiple datasets with SQL semantics**                          | Complex joins, CTEs, and window functions are supported.                      |
| ✅ You want to **persist results in database files**                                  | DuckDB can save tables or databases locally like SQLite.                      |

## Use both together

Use Both Together? YES!

They complement each other:

- Use DuckDB to query large Parquet files (e.g., filter or join), and pass the result to Polars for fast in-memory processing.

- DuckDB supports FROM polars_df if you enable it via Python bindings.
